**Welcome to Dulasrys, Your Integrity-Centric Testing Platform**

At Dulasrys, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of academic integrity. Our platform functions akin to a BlueBook, designed to prevent dishonest practices during examinations.

**Our Anti-Cheating Measures:**
We employ robust measures to detect and deter cheating. Should any form of dishonesty be identified during a test, appropriate actions will be taken in accordance with our academic integrity policy.

**Consequences of Cheating:**
We believe in fairness and the value of hard work. As such, any violation of our integrity standards will result in disciplinary action, which may include but is not limited to, nullification of test results and further academic penalties.

Join us in fostering a culture of honesty and trust in the academic process.

**If you cheat during the test, we will punish you**

***We are against cheating!***
